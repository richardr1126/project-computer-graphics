# Final Project - CSCI5229 Computer Graphics

**Richard Roberson**
CSCI5229 Fall 2025

Implements texture mapping on a 3D scene with lighting. Features a textured terrain ground with varied height using sine wave combinations, along with the bullseye targets from previous assignments.

### Features Implemented
- **View Modes**: Switch between perspective (orbit), first-person, and orthographic views.
- **Smooth First-Person Move & Look**: Hold WASD to move, click-drag mouse to look around; motion is frame-rate independent, diagonals normalized, and camera angles use smooth double precision.
- **Lighting**: Animated light source (rendered as bright sphere) with ambient, diffuse, and specular components. Supports smooth and flat shading modes.
  - **Light Controls**: Adjust light height and distance, pause/resume rotation, manual rotation, and smooth/flat shading toggle.
  - **Normals Debugging**: Toggle display of normals for all objects.
- **Objects**:
  - **Ground**: Textured ground terrain with height variations.
  - **Bullseyes**: Three textured bullseye targets with animated motion.
  - **Light Sphere**: Represents the light source in the scene.

#### Debugging features
- Toggle normals display for objects to visualize lighting effects.

#### Zip File Contents
```bash
zip -r project.zip .

## How to run

From the `project/` folder:

```
make        # builds both 'project' and 'builder'
./project   # launch the full scene
```
